The tidy data in [tidy_data_set.txt](./tidy_data_set.txt) can be read into R with the following code:

	read.table("tidy_data_set.txt", header=TRUE, colClasses=c('factor', 'factor', rep('numeric', 66)))

## Overview

The [tidy_data_set.txt](./tidy_data_set.txt) file is a tidy subset of the data provided in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. The source data is available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones# and it's also included in the UCI HAR Dataset directory in this repo. 

tidy_data_set.txt includes the combined test and training data sets. [README.md](./README.md) includes a walk through of the data cleansing and transformation steps used to create tidy_data_set.txt.

The tidy data set is a subset of this combined data that includes only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measure. This reduces the data to 68 columns (68 feature variable measurements, plus the TestSubject and Activity columns). The size of the tidy data set was further reduced by averaging each variable for each activity and each subject. This resulted in 180 rows of data, with a unique combination of TestSubject and Activity values in each row. 

## Data dictionary

The variables in this tidy data set are a subset of the variables described in the [features_info.txt](./UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt) file in the original data set. [features_info.txt](./UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt) provides a more in-depth overview of the original values and how they were calculated.

1. **TestSubject** - A factor that identifies the volunteer participant.
	>Values: integer from 1 to 30

2. **Activity** - A factor that identifies the activity being performed
	> Values: Walking, WalkingUpStairs, WalkingDownStairs, Sitting, Standing, Lying

	***The feature variables below (#3 - #68) are each an average of the values collected for the test subject and activity specified in the data row. For each, the value is a numeric normalized and bounded within [-1, 1]***

## Note - Variable naming

I updated the feature variable names in the tidy data (vs. the names in the source data described in [features_info.txt](./UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt)) to make it easier for consumers of the data to understand the measurement of each column. The names use the following conventions:

- The first word(s) indicates the type of metric, **Mean** or **StandardDeviation**
- Next, **FFT** is included, if applicable, to indicate that the measurement had a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied. 
- Either **Body** or **Gravity** is included to indicate the type of signal
- Either **Acceleration** or **AngularVelocity** is included to indicate the type of measurement. I replaced "Gyro" with "AngularVelocity" since that's what the gyroscope is measuring.
- **Jerk** indicates a measure where the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
- **Magnitude** indicates a magnitude calculation
- **XAxis**, **YAxis**, and **ZAxis** indicate a measurement for the X, Y, or Z axis.

Here are some example mappings of old to new column names:

- Old: tBodyAcc-mean()-X
- New: MeanBodyAccelerationXAxis

- Old: tGravityAcc-std()-Y
- New: StandarddeviationGravityAccelerationYAxis

- Old: fBodyGyroMag-std()
- New: StandardDeviationFFTBodyAngularVelocityMagnitude
